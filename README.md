Mortgage Calculator developed for Mortgage Center

Introduction: Mortgage Center's old mortgage calculator was visually unappealing and had a confusing user experience, leading to a high bounce rate and low conversions. As a UX Designer and front-end developer, my goal was to create a new mortgage calculator that potential homebuyers would find easy to use and understand.

Research: To begin, I conducted user research to identify what potential homebuyers needed from a mortgage calculator. Based on user feedback, it became clear that the old calculator lacked critical features that users found necessary, leading to low engagement and conversions. This information helped me to identify the essential features that the new calculator needed to have to meet users' needs.

Design: With a clear understanding of what was needed, I moved on to designing the user interface. I created several mockups, each with a different approach, and presented them to leadership for approval. The chosen design focused on creating a clean and visually appealing interface that would be intuitive for users. I made sure to include all the essential features identified during the research phase.

Front-end Development: With the design approved, I started the front-end development phase. I used Bootstrap 4.5.2 to write the initial styling in HTML and then used CSS to modify the styling to match the approved mockup design. To complete the functionality of the mortgage calculator, I wrote JavaScript code to enable users to input relevant information and get accurate mortgage calculations.

Testing: After completing the coding phase, I conducted extensive testing to ensure that the calculator was functioning correctly and was easy to use. Through the testing process, I identified some minor issues that needed to be addressed, and I made the necessary changes.

Results: The new mortgage calculator has been a significant success, with a significant decrease in the bounce rate and an increase in conversions. The improved user experience and visually appealing design have made the tool easy to use and understand, which has had a significant impact on its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Good design matters on projects like Mortgage Center's mortgage calculator because it creates a user-friendly interface that encourages engagement and increases opportunities for conversions. User research is crucial to identifying what users need, and the design should focus on creating an intuitive interface with all the necessary features. Front-end development must ensure that the design is accurately implemented, and thorough testing is essential to ensuring functionality and usability. Through my experience in UX and development, I was able to transform Mortgage Center's old mortgage calculator into a tool that potential homebuyers can easily use and understand.
